Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
================================================

The course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course part of the Data Science Specialization track on Coursera.

##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
      
      1. Merges the training and the test data sets to create one data set.
      2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
      3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
      5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
      for each activity and each subject.

## Data
The data sets used in this project represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The data sets being used can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The training and the test data sets are merged to create one data set.
